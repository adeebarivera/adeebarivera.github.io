Wow!!! what a journey it has been, from every emotions i have felt in these months was all worth it. I myself am in unbelife that i was able to do this, specially with this covid burden. This is my second cohort and i am very glad that i restarted because it helped me alot. Before, restarting i was upset because I had to start over not being able to comprehend that i was able to grasp on to the concept better.

I DIDN'T GIVE UP!! the best part of the story i was able to comply every ideas that i had from my first cohort project. What seemed impossible wasnt any more. 

My project was about make up search app, it went into details. As you entered it said "WELCOME TO ADEEBA'S MAKEUP VAULT" then a cool ACII image popped up. It asked the user if they wanted to see the list. The first list gave out name and type of makeup, Once they picked a number from the list it would give them a price, description and the link. Next, it will give them another prompt to continue, if not the it would exit from of the program by saying "GOOD BYE"!. Isn't that pretty neat???? there is no way i could have done all that couple months ago. Thank you FLATIRON staff for all the help!!! You guys are awesome.
