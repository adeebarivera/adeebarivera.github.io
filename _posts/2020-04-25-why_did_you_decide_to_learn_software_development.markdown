 Now that my kids are bit grown and having a great support of my family. I decided to go back to school. I was enrolled in strayer university for computer networking but I wasnt able to finish due to personal issues. One day, I came across a friend who is a programmer. He told me the pros and cons about coding. It sparked a interest in me. Since then I started looking into software development field. So far I am very excited of this career change. I cannot wait to see what type of job I will end up landing. As I have done my research I saw the need in this field. I am confident not just I came across a great school "Flat Iron" but also the guidance I will get through this school. I cannot Wait!
